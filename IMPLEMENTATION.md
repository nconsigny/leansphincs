# Statement and harness implementation contract

Status: reviewed-rule implementation for draft v0.17, 2026-09-11.
This is not a frozen competition, an accepted cryptographic baseline or a
deployment certificate. Historical decisions and validation snapshots are retained
in [SCHEMECLAIM_PLAN.md](SCHEMECLAIM_PLAN.md).

## Oracle and interface

`Oracle.lean` supplies arbitrary byte-list inputs and 256-bit outputs, with one
lazy ROM shared by key generation, adversarial hashing, signing and final
verification. Uniform sampling is separate. Verification work is the sum of
`(input.length + 63) / 64` over every call, including repeated and empty calls:
empty costs zero weighted units but still one raw security query. All supplied
domain tags count. Meter identifier: `rom256-input64-ceil-v1`.

`SchemeInterface.lean` fixes messages to 32-byte digests. A submission selects its
secret-key type and algorithms:
`keygen -> (pk, sk)`, `sign(sk, message) -> Option Bytes`,
`verify(pk, message, signature) -> Bool`.
Signing has no mutable state or epoch argument/output. Verification may hash but
does not sample random coins. Public keys and signatures are actual wire bytes.

Immutable precomputation may be included in the secret-key value. There is no
required auxiliary cache/presign interface or free 4 KiB cache allowance.
Disclosure/replacement/delegation needs a separately reviewed game extension;
secret/precomputation storage and complete-program resource bounds remain to bind.

`CorrectOnSuccess` requires probability one of either explicit failure or a
verifying output in the fresh-key experiment. Independently,
`HasSigningFailureBound S 128` bounds failure for every fixed message, averaged
over key generation, signing randomness and their shared ROM. The proved
`.mono` lemma transports a 256-bit certificate to the 128-bit gate.
This is not a per-key conditional or adaptive lifetime-availability guarantee.

Exact signature size covers every successful output on every path from a
generated key; public keys are bounded by **32 bytes** on every keygen path.
The verification bound includes malformed inputs.

## Pure-ROM game and total work

`Game.lean` logs all signing requests and optional responses. Only an exact
successful message/signature replay is excluded; a different valid signature
on an already-signed message wins. Repeated and failed signing requests are
charged equally and are visible to the adversary.

`HasHashQueryBound` bounds raw calls across the **whole experiment**, including
challenger keygen, honest signing, final verification and adversarial hashing;
uniform sampling is excluded. `HasSigningQueryBound` bounds requests on every
adversarial path for every public key. These are not expected work bounds.

The security bound's first argument is **Q = qH + qS**, not just adversarial
hashing or weighted verification work. The actual game is unchanged; the claim's
accounting and theorem coverage are revised. Bounds are conservative when the
chosen budgets exceed actual query use.

Arbitrary pure computations are expressible. Eligibility requires an
unconditional, end-to-end ROM theorem with all internal reduction premises
discharged. There is no conjectural assumption registry, separate proof-style
exception or construction classifier by family name. Allowed axioms are exactly
`propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`.

## Fixed exact bound and lifetime certificates

A `BoundTerm` represents
`(numerator / (denominatorPred + 1)) * Q^a * qS^b / 2^k`.
The declared coefficient list is fixed independently of either query budget.
The host format enforces 1–128 positive reduced terms with bounded exponents;
the underlying mathematical evaluator also supports zero coefficients/empty
lists for general lemmas and tests.

For a fixed signing cap S and bit level b, `MeetsFloor` checks
`B(1,S) <= 2^-b` and `B(2^b,S) <= 1`.
Convexity of `B(Q,S) - Q/2^b` gives the full interval inequality.
`meetsFloor_iff` characterizes this **fixed-cap** interval exactly;
`evalBound_mono_signing` transports it to any smaller signing budget.

This includes numerical points Q < S. It is therefore a conservative sufficient
certificate for the feasible two-budget security region, not the tightest
possible test restricted to Q >= qS. No enumeration of 2^124 values is needed.
`bitSecurity` is reporting only; acceptance uses `MeetsFloor`.
`idealize` remains a historical arithmetic helper and is never an eligibility
predicate. Equivalent bounds must not acquire different eligibility by moving
powers of two between coefficients and denominators.

`SchemeClaim` requires one security theorem for all qS <= 2^32:
`Adv <= B(qH + qS, qS)`. It then checks both:

- `MeetsFloor coeffs (2^20) 124`;
- `MeetsFloor coeffs (2^32) 100`.

`SchemeClaim.security_le` and `.decay_le` derive the respective total-work
probability inequalities. Both refer to the **same S, parameters and coefficients**.
A theorem limited to 2^24 requests cannot supply the latter obligation just
because its polynomial numerically passes. `LeanSphincsTest/ReviewRules.lean`
checks the 32-byte boundary, separate decay gate and constants-dropping ambiguity.

There is no QROM gate, generic classical/2 guarantee or organizer commitment to
later formalize one.

## Comparator, declarations and pricing

The comparator's sole definition hole is the submitted `SigScheme`.
All other reachable statement definitions, including both floors, must match.
Algorithm and theorem axiom closures are audited.

The three declarations remain `sigma.txt`, `hverify.txt` and `bound.txt`.
The first two contain canonical positive integers <= 2^63-1.
Each bound row is `[numerator, denominator, a, b, k]`, with positive reduced
fraction, natural exponents <= 1024, and distinct monomials sorted by `(a,b,k)`.
The first exponent now applies to total work Q. Numeric format compatibility
does not imply statement-semantic compatibility.

Receipt claim identifier: `suf-cma-total-work-pk32-decay-v1`.
The hash meter identifier is unchanged. Old receipts must be reverified against
the revised claim; changed protected hashes and the claim identifier distinguish
them. The renderer still binds all three declarations.

The objective is **c * sigma + hverify** for the hash-work profile, computed
with exact rational arithmetic. The price is read from organizer-owned
`benchmark/scoring.json`, included in the harness manifest and integrity checks.
The profile currently has `bandwidth_price: null`: **no scalar score is emitted**,
even on accepted local verification. A calibrated price must be a positive
reduced rational with bounded integer components. It is never an entrant file.
Research experiments may explore explicitly supplied prices, always unranked.

A configured score is emitted only after successful comparison and post-run
integrity checks. Every receipt is still `ranked: false`. The declarations-only
score helper also reports unverified/unranked status. The OTS additive Lean
helpers prove arithmetic properties, not algorithm certificates.

## Trust boundary, provenance and launch work

Source admission is flat, bounded and import-checked: 1,000 files, 4 MiB per file,
10 MiB total; no symlinks, dynamic elaborators, native_decide or build-time
execution. Protected sources and dependencies are read-only in candidate runs.
Private per-run projects, fresh candidate outputs, axiom checks, kernel checking,
admission locking, atomic receipts and integrity rechecks are described in
[HARNESS_SECURITY.md](HARNESS_SECURITY.md). None is an external audit.

The five positive/negative metric comparator canaries do not establish security.
WS5 needs mutation tests built from an accepted baseline; WS6 needs serialization,
game and cost transport, signing failure and same-scheme lifetime decay.
The full executable binding, 1.5 s signing / 60 s keygen / 64 KiB RAM gates,
persistent storage profile, execution cap and price calibration remain unfinished.
No fixed hash-unit-to-seconds conversion is asserted. Independent verifier
registration, audit, governance and promotion still precede launch.
