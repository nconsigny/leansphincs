# SchemeClaim: current plan and decision history

Status: draft v0.17 implementation, 2026-09-11. The
[public rules](https://nconsigny.github.io/leansphincs/) and
[implementation contract](IMPLEMENTATION.md) describe the current target.
Historical notes below are snapshots, not competing current instructions.

## Current decisions: Benedikt review accepted, 2026-09-11

1. Both stages use `c * signatureBytes + verificationWork`, within separately
   pinned games and meters. c is an organizer-owned positive rational, pending
   calibration. No implicit price, no scalar ranking before calibration.
   The former product and four-factor objectives are superseded.
2. Complete-account limits remain 1.5 s signing, 60 s keygen and 64 KiB working
   RAM. Full-program worst-case bounds include retries and arithmetic.
   Hardware calibration, storage limits and component budgets remain open.
   Historical hash-throughput conversions are not resource certificates.
3. Pure-ROM, end-to-end Lean proofs only. No extra cryptographic assumptions,
   constants-dropping gate, named construction ban or separate proof-style rule.
   Internal modular reductions must discharge their own premises.
4. Security is SUF-CMA with total query work Q = qH + qS. qH counts the entire
   experiment including challenger hashes; qS counts failed/repeated requests.
   Bound length, coefficients and exponents are fixed independently of budgets.
5. One scheme, parameters and bound must satisfy 124 bits at 2^20 requests and
   100 bits at 2^32. The security theorem itself covers qS <= 2^32.
   The fixed-cap endpoint certificate is conservative even at Q < signingCap.
6. Public keys are at most 32 bytes. Successful signature size remains an
   equality. The single arbitrary-input/32-byte-output oracle and per-call
   `ceil(inputBytes / 64)` work remain unchanged.
7. Standard keygen/sign/verify structure; immutable preprocessing may live in sk.
   No mandatory separate cache/presign channel. Any public disclosure/replacement
   extension requires its own model; it is no longer on the core critical path.
8. Correctness on success and fixed-message fresh-key failure <= 2^-128 remain
   separate. Stronger 2^-256 certificates qualify. Adaptive lifetime availability
   is not inferred from this clause.
9. Academic Stage 1 is broader than OTS: few-time components, encodings,
   authentication, composition and complete constructions are also in scope.
   Standard hybrid multi-instance reductions may be used with their loss and
   actual shared-RO/domain-separation conditions accounted for.
10. Automatic numerical ranking and human-curated research/negative-result
    credit are separate. No QROM formalization promise or generic classical/2
    guarantee. Final award/adoption approval is still pending.
11. GitHub remains canonical under the existing organizer decision; agent
    publication instructions live in AGENTS.md, not the rules page.

## Implemented protected statement

```lean
structure SchemeClaim (S : SigScheme)
    (sigmaBytes hVerify : Nat) (coeffs : BoundCoeffs) : Prop where
  correct         : CorrectOnSuccess S
  signing_failure : HasSigningFailureBound S 128
  sigma_positive  : 0 < sigmaBytes
  sigma_size      : HasSignatureSize S sigmaBytes
  public_key_size : HasPublicKeySize S 32
  hverify_positive : 0 < hVerify
  verify_queries  : HasVerificationBound S hVerify
  security        : ∀ A qH qS, qS ≤ 2^32 →
    HasHashQueryBound S A qH → HasSigningQueryBound A qS →
    sufAdvantage S A ≤ boundProbability coeffs (qH + qS) qS
  floor           : MeetsFloor coeffs (2^20) 124
  decay_floor     : MeetsFloor coeffs (2^32) 100
```

Explanatory expansion of the constants; the normative file is
`LeanSphincs/Benchmark/Claim.lean`. The comparator leaves only S as a definition
hole and binds all three declarations. The claim identifier is
`suf-cma-total-work-pk32-decay-v1`; meter `rom256-input64-ceil-v1` is unchanged.
Old declarations/receipts need re-verification, not relabeling.

The exact evaluator and its convex endpoint proof remain independent of VCVio.
The new signing-budget monotonicity lemma and `SchemeClaim.security_le` /
`.decay_le` prove both advertised total-work inequalities. Regression fixtures
exercise the smaller key cap, separate decay certificate and constants ambiguity.

## Workstreams and next priorities

- **WS1: library coordination.** HashSig oracle-ization is independent of the
  statement. Coordinate with Quang/Alex and Emile's SPHINCS/OTS work; do not
  silently move the reproduced reference pin or duplicate his active work.
- **WS2: oracle, interface and game.** Implemented. No new cache/epoch interface
  is needed for the core syntax. Keep raw queries separate from weighted work.
- **WS3: fixed bounds.** Implemented with exact endpoint and monotonicity proofs.
  Keep all constants. Any future tighter feasible-budget gate requires a new
  theorem and explicit versioning, not a silent change to this certificate.
- **WS4: claim, comparator and pricing.** Revised claim and organizer-owned
  additive profile implemented. An unset c issues no scalar score; all local
  receipts stay unranked. Full execution and S/K budget binding remain to add.
- **WS5: production negative tests.** Existing real-comparator canaries and
  actual-claim rejection fixtures are diagnostic coverage. Complete the matrix
  by mutating a genuinely accepted baseline, including both lifetime fields.
- **WS6: baseline #0.** An eligible **SPHINCS⁻ variant**, not a weakened target.
  The pinned 126-bit theorem at 2^24 requests is promising, but still needs
  byte serialization, game/query transport, weighted verification, failure
  probability and a same-parameter security extension to 2^32 requests.
  Passing numerical floor examples does not finish that extension.
- **Academic targets.** With Emile, pin the first component game and per-track
  budgets without limiting Stage 1 to OTS or assuming a fully black-box use.
  Existing graph, counting and failure-envelope code is experimental.
- **Execution and launch.** Bind the executable to the Lean algorithms, account
  for full arithmetic/memory/retries and establish worst-case resource bounds.
  Calibrate c and the wallet profile, set storage/verifier caps, then finish
  baseline validation, governance, external audit, verifier registration and
  authenticated frontier promotion before opening submissions.

The 124-bit floor is unchanged; any future higher-floor proposal needs a separate
decision and baseline evidence. Repo governance, prizes and timeline remain open.
No lower-security launch workaround is authorized by this plan.

## Validation of the reviewed implementation (2026-09-11)

84 host tests pass, including pricing provenance, rejection of entrant-owned
pricing, the fixed 128-term limit and current website rules. The complete
`lake build LeanSphincs LeanSphincsTest` succeeds (3313 jobs); protected and
experimental OTS axiom audits admit only the three standard axioms.
The strict Linux profile passes all 11 boundary probes, all five metric
comparator canaries and all four actual-claim rejection cases (forged axiom,
sorry, weakened statement and oracle escape). Rejected receipts bind the new
claim identifier and null organizer price and contain no score. Desktop/mobile
page previews were checked. These are local diagnostics, not a cryptographic
baseline, external audit, remote-CI result or deployment certificate.

## Historical working notes (superseded where inconsistent above)

The following notes preserve prior decisions, estimates and validation dates.
References to older objectives, auxiliary channels, constants-dropping rules,
hash-to-time conversions or publication targets are historical only.

## Local implementation progress (2026-09-06)

2026-09-10, v0.15 meter decision: arbitrary byte-string input, fixed 32-byte output,
with `ceil(inputBytes / 64)` work per call, charging supplied domain-separation
bytes. The literal ceiling assigns zero weight to empty input; raw security
query counts and cycle accounting remain separate. This updates the protected
`hashWeight` and invalidates cross-meter score comparisons, not the SUF-CMA
game or proof assumptions. Receipts identify `rom256-input64-ceil-v1`;
experiments use `rom32-input64`, preserving `rom32` as a historical profile.
Boundary, repeat-charge and empty-query-budget regressions are included in Lean
and host tests. The source-level annex and PR #19 estimates become 810 keygen
units and 531 verification units respectively, not accepted cost certificates.
Under fixed size/signing constraints, verification-minimizing search must allow
Reed–Solomon-coded candidates, with no presumption that chains are optimal.

2026-09-10, v0.16 decision: the objective returns to `size * verification`.
Signing work and keygen work are fixed as hard budgets rather than scored: signing
stays at 1.5 s, keygen moves from 45 s to 1 minute at the 160 MHz anchor (hash-work
view: about 8.5 × 10^4 and 3.4 × 10^6 units). The oracle meter is unchanged
(`ceil(inputBytes / 64)`, 32-byte output). Stage 1 is framed as academic research
on pure hash work; Stage 2 is the Ethereum selection. The v0.14 four-factor
objective and beta = 1/4 are superseded; the OTS experiment CLI keeps its rank key
as a research view only. The Stage 1 board gets two tabs, Spacetime (ranking) and
Pareto (size/verification frontier at the fixed budgets). The legacy
`sigma * hverify` score now coincides with the objective; the S/K budget
certificates and their comparator binding remain to implement.

2026-09-10, v0.14 decisions and publication: apply the four-factor objective with
beta = 1/4 to both stages, retain hard usability gates and existing 45 s / 1.5 s
wallet budgets, and expose full instruction/memory work alongside the hash view.
Polynomial/Reed–Solomon coding is not excluded for being algebraic, but its
correlations and execution costs must be proved/metered. The final prize profile,
cycle weights/caps and signing-work quantifier remain open. Website v0.14 is
maintained on GitHub, now canonical by explicit organizer decision (2026-09-10).
The earlier Claude artifact is a legacy copy, no longer a synchronized target;
publication proceeds from this repo's `main` branch without waiting for it. The protected
legacy claim is unchanged and does not certify the new K/S factors.

Validation for v0.14: 62 Python tests passed (including website decision/link
checks and annex arithmetic), `lake build LeanSphincs LeanSphincsTest` succeeds,
and both protected/experimental axiom audits admit only standard axioms. Desktop
and 390-pixel mobile previews were checked locally. None of these checks is a
deployment, a complete cycle certificate or acceptance of a cryptographic entry.

Next execution-accounting work, coordinated with Emile rather than changing his
OTS construction interface prematurely:

1. Pin separately identified hash-work and execution profiles, including query
   byte layouts, instruction/memory accounting, signing-work quantifiers and
   setup/delegation treatment. No fixed conversion from abstract hash-work units to
   concrete compression blocks or cycles is assumed.
2. Build an encoding-kernel comparison on matched profiles: existing chain/
   codebook operations and the supplied polynomial shape when its full algorithm
   is available. Retain operation counts, measured timings and proved bounds as
   distinct evidence; no hash-only result establishes a latency improvement.
3. Bind the executable to the Lean oracle scheme, then prove complete K/S/V and
   memory bounds, including malformed inputs and bounded retry exhaustion.
   Connect the failure-envelope premise to the actual adaptive ROM/cache game.
4. Version the stage-specific claim and comparator to bind the two score factors and the signing/keygen budget certificates.
   Keep the current three-file MVP unranked until that transition and the
   baseline/launch gates are complete. See [annex review](POLYNOMIAL_CODING_REVIEW.md).

2026-09-09 OTS exploration: the organizer requests a four-factor objective
`size * signing * verification * keygen^beta`, with lower keygen weight. Beta = 1/4
is now approved; expected-versus-worst-case signing semantics remain pending. Experimental exact
ranking, Lean graph/cost foundations and a re-metered fixed-family counting engine
are implemented separately from the protected MVP. See [OTS_STAGE1.md](OTS_STAGE1.md)
for evidence, assumptions and the remaining security/composition proof milestones.
Neither the full-scheme score nor the published spec changes in this batch.
The next increment adds actual byte-level graph oracle evaluation, injective
address/value encoding and a worst-case weighted-query theorem, including
missing-input rejection and repeated gates. Graph correctness, codebook decoding,
availability and strong one-time security remain separate unfinished obligations.
The subsequent increment proves reconstruction under an oracle-consistent
reference and adaptive failure envelopes with explicit exception allowances.
The requested worst-case probability treatment is documented in OTS_STAGE1.md;
it is not a claim that the concrete signer satisfies the freshness premise or
that a single-request bound automatically extends to an entire key lifetime.

2026-09-09 shipping progress: receipt integrity and SIGTERM handling were committed
and pushed unsigned in `e639597` (no co-author trailer). The next harness batch
adds per-checkout admission locking and retryable `worker_busy` receipts before
candidate access, with 45 host tests. This advances worker admission, not the
remaining external scheduler, aggregate disk quota or cryptographic baseline.

2026-09-09 independent harness work: cooperative CLI SIGTERM cleanup now follows
the interruption path, with process-group and systemd-stop regression coverage
(37 host tests). The OTS target, composition contract and audited reference pin
remain untouched. Emile's branch advanced to
[`68a0bac`](https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanVM-b/commit/68a0bacd9fb8456a8a4c25717cbb83bf9ea6c5fc),
whose commit report leaves the public 126-bit statement unchanged and the final
127-bit theorem open. That revision has not been rebuilt locally here.

2026-09-08 independent harness work: receipts now recheck dependency pins and
tool hashes before scoring and publish complete JSON atomically; 33 host tests
cover integrity drift, orchestration failures and receipt publication. The core
and first sandbox hardening were committed in `31a5f92`; spec v0.13 followed in
`4ae1d37`. These receipt changes do not modify the protected Lean claim.

Coordination: leave the proposed OTS target and composition contract open while
Emile (GitHub `TomWambsgans`) completes his exploration. Monitor
[sphincs-fv](https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanVM-b/tree/sphincs-fv) before
integration; do not move the reproduced PR #19 pin automatically. The branch
snapshot `990b2ce5fa1ee99d8a0797da163db46bc498cf7f` reports reduction improvements
and explicitly leaves the final 127-bit inequality open. This is an upstream
commit report, not a local reproduction of that revision.

2026-09-07 harness advance: per-run source capture and isolated build outputs,
read-only protected/dependency caches, mandatory Linux sandbox probes and
content-bound receipts are implemented. All four real `SchemeClaim` rejection
cases and all five metric-only canaries pass in the strict Linux profile; 22
host tests pass. See [HARNESS_SECURITY.md](HARNESS_SECURITY.md).
This advances WS5 without claiming baseline #0, external audit, registration or
production freeze is complete.

WS2, WS3 and WS4 now have a staged implementation in this checkout, documented in [IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md). The protected Lean library builds on Lean 4.31.0 / VCVio `cbd4144b51d92da00dd50f05e068b2348fa6e529`; its axiom audit admits only the three standard axioms. The exact rational floor predicate has a proved two-endpoint characterization. The comparator has one scheme-definition hole and binds all three declared metric files. Organizer canaries exercise successful matching, rejection of each changed metric, and forbidden-axiom rejection; they are not baseline #0.

Verified again on 2026-09-07 after the previous session was cut off: the protected library builds, the axiom audit passes, the ten host-side contract tests pass, the signing-failure regression fixtures (always-failing signer rejected, invalid successful output rejected, failed requests charged to the signing budget, `none` never counts as replay) compile, the five comparator canary fixtures were recreated for the `Option Bytes` signing interface and all five real-comparator runs return the expected verdicts, and the PR #19 126-bit endpoint was reproduced locally with a standard-axiom footprint (see PR19_REVIEW.md). A `LeanSphincsTest.lean` root now lets `lake build LeanSphincsTest` succeed. This work was subsequently committed in `31a5f92`.

The WS2 block convention is now pinned to `ceil(inputBytes / 64)`, charging all supplied bytes, including domain separation, with zero weight for empty input. This supersedes the staged 32-byte input unit and one-unit minimum. The canonical GitHub spec source is v0.15 (2026-09-10), retaining the signing-failure decision introduced in v0.13. Repo home and merge rights remain deferred.

[leanVM-b PR #19](https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanVM-b/pull/19) supplies an additional, directly relevant stateless SUF-CMA proof route: a public 126-bit statement at 2²⁴ signing requests, with the same whole-experiment ROM accounting. See [PR19_REVIEW.md](PR19_REVIEW.md). It can shorten WS6 without waiting for WS1, but needs serialization, game/cap transport and block-weighted verification proofs. Its signer returns `Option Signature` after bounded grinding. Following discussion with Emile and organizer approval on 2026-09-06, the staged contract now admits explicit signing failure, with separate correctness-on-success and failure-probability ≤ 2⁻¹²⁸ obligations. This is a per-fixed-message, fresh-key/shared-ROM gate, not an adaptive lifetime guarantee. Baseline transport and production validation remain; the contract is not yet frozen for submissions.
