# Instructions for agents working on this repository

Humans read the published rules; this file is for the AI agents and scripts that
edit them. Keep it short and factual.

## Publication

- **GitHub is canonical** (organizer decision, 2026-09-10). `index.html` on `main`
  is the single source of the competition rules, published unchanged to GitHub
  Pages at https://nconsigny.github.io/leansphincs/.
- The earlier Claude artifact
  (https://claude.ai/code/artifact/44cc19cb-44bb-475b-a1c0-e4aad483010a) is a
  frozen legacy copy at draft v0.13. Never republish it, never treat it as the
  current rules, and never wait for it before pushing to `main`.
- Do not tell readers any of the above inside `index.html`. Publication
  mechanics belong here, not in the rules.

## Editing the rules

1. Read the verbatim HTML before replacing text. Plain-text extraction hides
   inline markup such as `<strong>`, `<sub>` and `<span class="tbd">`, and an
   edit that matches the wrong string silently changes nothing.
2. Bump the version marker in the status line and the footer together, and set
   the status-line date.
3. Update `tests/test_website.py` in the same change: it asserts the version and
   the load-bearing sentences of the current rules, and CI runs it.
4. Keep the companion documents consistent: `README.md`, `SCHEMECLAIM_PLAN.md`,
   `IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `SUBMISSION.md`, `OTS_STAGE1.md`,
   `POLYNOMIAL_CODING_REVIEW.md`. Record superseded decisions as history rather
   than deleting them.
5. Style: no em dashes in prose; no vendor or platform names for the
   infrastructure behind sibling competitions (naming the competitions
   themselves is fine); friendly framing toward leanSig, which is a parallel
   track on the consensus layer, not a rival.
6. Amber `<span class="tbd">` marks a value or decision still open. Remove the
   span when the decision closes.

## Checking a change

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
lake build LeanSphincs LeanSphincsTest
lake env lean scripts/check-axioms.lean
```

`lake build` output piped through `tail` hides the exit code; read `PIPESTATUS`.
